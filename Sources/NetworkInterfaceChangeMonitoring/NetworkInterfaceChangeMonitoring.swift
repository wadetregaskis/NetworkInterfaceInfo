    ///
    /// Note that there may be a delay between the actual changes occuring and them being reported (even if `coalescingPeriod` is 0).  This function relies on the ``Network/NWPathMonitor`` functionality from Apple, and while typically Apple's library provides notification of changes immediately, at other times it takes longer.  There is no defined upper bound on this latency, and delays on the order of minutes have been observed in practice.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - coalescingPeriod: How long to wait, after detecting a change, before actually reporting it.  A negative or zero value means no wait.
    ///
    ///     Having a coalescing period allows multiple changes to be coalesced into one, which may improve the semantic accuracy of the reported changes (particularly regarding recognising modifications properly, as opposed to a removal followed by an addition).  The downsides are that it delays change reports, and it may cause some changes to be missed entirely (e.g. addition followed by removal).
    ///
    ///     The ideal value is use-case specific.  If you don't care whether you see changes as single modifications vs pairs of adds and removes, a value of zero (the default) is the best.  Otherwise, a single second is helpful but typically not sufficient to coalesce all modifications.  Several seconds is usually sufficient, but there can still be exceptions.  Consider what the delay means for your use-case - e.g. if it takes a while to switch wifi networks, during which time the internet is not accessible, are you satisfied with eventually just receiving notification of a change in wifi settings or do you want to know more immediately that access via wifi has been [temporarily] lost?
